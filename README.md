# PPVR

[PPVR](https://ppvr.andrus.io/) is an alternative osu! ranking system based on the scores of scoreposts on the game's subreddit [/r/osugame](https://www.reddit.com/r/osugame/).

 this is why

This was originally a university project, and consists of two parts. The first one is this Laravel-based ranking website and the [other](https://github.com/Andrusowski/ppvr-bot) is a vanilla PHP skript which parses new reddit posts and puts them in a database.

Everything should be in a usable state, but there are still some minor features like more stats and graphs that I still have to implement.

Thanks to [christopher-dG](https://github.com/christopher-dG) for making osu-bot, where I took some regular expressions and constants from.
